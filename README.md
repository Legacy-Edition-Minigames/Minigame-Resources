An addon to Compliance and LEB CustomPack

## Installation

- Install [Compliance](https://compliancepack.net/compliance32x/latest) as a resource pack
- Download Compliance-LEB from [Releases](https://github.com/Lion8cake/Compliance-LEB/releases)
- **Make sure Compliance-LEB is above Compliance! It will not work properly if this is not done.**

LEB CustomPack by default disables Per-Map Texture packs! If you would like to keep using Per-Map Texture packs, type `/trigger maptextures` **after you have enabled CustomPack! Do not to it before it.**
